# Infrastructure decisions

Recorded 2026-10-24. These are the infrastructure choices confirmed with the owner before the build. Design decisions live in a separate design-decisions.md (created during the design intake step).

## AI provider: NVIDIA NIM

Key lives in server environment only (NVIDIA_API_KEY in .env.local, never committed).

Verified against the live API on 2026-10-24 with this account:

| Role | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Default chat (fast) | nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b | Must send chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking = false, otherwise it returns only reasoning content. 535ms for a small prompt with thinking off. |
| Strong chat (multi-passage questions) | nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b | Works with thinking off. |
| Embeddings | nvidia/nemotron-3.5-embed-1b | 2048 dimensions. Asymmetric: requires input_type = passage when indexing and input_type = query when searching. |

Model names are read from configuration, as the PRD requires, so they can change without code edits.

Gated on this account (HTTP 404), do not use: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b, nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct, nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-instruct.

## Database and storage: Supabase

- Project name: documind, region ap-southeast-1 (Singapore), id xrfpxtpjqhdfykmwolbv, cost confirmed at 0 USD per month (free tier).
- Postgres with pgvector for chunk embeddings. Vector column size is 2048 to match the embedding model.
- Supabase Storage for uploaded files. The browser uploads directly to storage so the Vercel request body limit never applies, and the server verifies type and size after registration.
- The service role key is not exposed by the management tooling, so the owner adds SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from the Supabase dashboard.

## Deployment: Vercel for the whole app

Confirmed with the owner: the frontend and the backend both run on Vercel (Next.js server routes for upload registration, streaming ask, ingestion, billing webhooks), Supabase holds the database and storage, and NVIDIA holds the models.

Render.com is not part of the initial architecture. It comes back only as a background worker if ingestion jobs ever exceed what Vercel functions can run. The owner performs the final Vercel deployment after local testing passes.

## Repository workflow

- Public repository, created on 2026-10-24 as thezenigma/documind, because the PRD definition of done requires a public repo.
- Push after each feature is built and tested. No untested work on the remote.
- Secrets never enter the repository. .env* is gitignored and .env.example carries the shape only.

## Design skill routing

The PRD section 11 assigns Taste the direction step, but the repository DESIGN.md says an existing DESIGN.md means the direction is already decided. DESIGN.md wins on conflict, so Taste does not run a direction step. The design-decisions.md file records the decisions inherited from PRD section 11 instead.
